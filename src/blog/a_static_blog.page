When I decided to open up a new blog I needed a place to share my thoughts about technology.
I cryed for some pages where to publish the solutions about the programming problems I face everyday.
Most problems are already well examined elsewhere, but sometimes there are some problems 
for which there isn't a answer yet.
So this blog will just be an home for all the answers I'll found! 

The first problem I faced was strangely caused by this blog itself, which may sound really strange.
As I want to run my own website and not to write on a free blog, I firstly considered to use [Wordpress][],
which is the state of art in the blogosphere, but unfortunately it has a main drawback: it's _dynamic_. 
Well, you'll now think that I'm just a fool, but as I want to host my blog somewhere under my control, 
[Wordpress][] is just a source of problem.
As it's dynamic it requires some degree of maintenance due to security bugs, otherwise it's possible 
that my website will be defaced or worst. 
It should be fun to write a blog, and I don't want any hassles.
So, I took a different direction.

The blog you're now seeing is **static**, like many others in the blogosphere. 
As it's static, there are no bugs that an attacker might use to break it. 
And fortunately requires no mantainence from the programming point of view :).
However the post's comments should be stored somewhere, and they requires some level
of dynamicity that is provided by the great [Disqus][] comment system,
which allows any of you to place comments here as you would have done in a [Wordpress][] blog.

Even if this blog is static, it's not generated by a frontpage-like tool but by one of the most 
powerful static site generator: [Webgen][].
This tool, written in [Ruby][], allows to keep separeted contents and layouts and, most importantly,
to extend it by adding new types of contents and by modifying the website build process.
In fact I have crafted some addons to generate the main blog page, to generate image thumbnails,
and to mantain a multilanguage website updated.
This website and all those addons are available at my [GitHub][] page, in the [website][branch],
feel free to study, copy, and improve it and it as you like.
I'll be posting about them soon, so stay tuned if you're interested.
