One of the most useful feature of modern web applications is that they
automatically resize and generates the thumbnails of the uploaded images.
I personally hate wasting time and so I decided to add auto-resizing and
auto-thumbnailing to my blog, which if you can't remember is
[static]({relocatable: /blog/a_static_blog.html}) and powered by [Webgen][].

## The Requirements

First of all the image manipulation extension should not work if not 
specifically requested to, i.e. it should generates no problems when installed 
on a quite old website with tons of images already processed.
Secondly the image manipulation extension should by default both resize and
thumbnail every specified image.
Thirdly the process should be customizable, generally through the use
of a _\*.metainfo_ file, so a particular image could have a specific size, or
even not resized at all.

## The Library

Fortunately there is the wonderful [RMagick][] library which does the heavy
lifting for us: it takes care of resizing and thumbnailing.
The only downside of using it is that it should actually be installed on the
system so please refer to the [rmagick documentation][rmagick-install-doc].

[RMagick][] allows to resize an image in a pretty quick way:
<pre name="code" class="ruby">
    width = height = 200
    image = Magick::Image.read("path/to/your/image").first
    image.resize_to_fit!(width, height)
</pre>

As you can see with these few lines of code is possible to achieve almost all
its needed by this extension with these few lines.

## Introducing the Thumbnailer SourceHandler

In order to satisfy the requirements I had to write a [SourceHandler][] for a
new type of files, which without imagination must have the suffix _".image"_.
In this way it's possible to selectively manipulate only the specified images,
so it's a a drop-in extension for any webgen website.
Activating this extension it's super-easy:
 1. download the extension code (which is at the bottom of this page),
 2. add these lines to your _init.rb_:
<pre name="code" class="ruby">
    require "thumbnailer"
    Thumbnailer.setup
</pre>

Another requirement dictates that all parameters, such as image and thumb sizes,
should be completely customizable through the use of the
[webgen metainformations][metainfo].
Here it's a sample with the default values
<pre name="code" class="ruby">
\--- name:alcn
path_to_your_image.image:
    image.width: 300
    image.height: 300
    thumb.width: 100
    thumb.height: 100
    resize: true
    thumb: true
    image.polaroid: false
    thumb.polaroid: false
</pre>

However it's possible to set these metainfos for the whole website, through
the use of the _init.rb_ file:
<pre name="code" class="ruby">
config = Webgen::WebsiteAccess.website.config
config['sourcehandler.default_meta_info']['Thumbnailer'] = {
      "image.width" => 300,
      "image.height" => 300,
      "thumb.width" => 100,
      "thumb.height" => 100,
      "resize" => true,
      "thumb" => true,
      "image.polaroid" => false,
      "thumb.polaroid" => false
    }
</pre>

This [blog]({relocatable: /blog.html}) is kind of a show-case of this functionality, in fact in that page
there are displayed the thumbnails of the post images generated through this
extension.

## The Polaroid Effect

There is a little benefit in using [RMagick][] to resize the images: it provides
tons of effects that can be applied to them.
One of these is the [polaroid effect][polaroid], which generates the nice images
visible in the linked page (and in this blog, if it hasn't changed).


## The Code

<pre name="code" class="ruby">
{include_file: {tag.includefile.filename: ext/thumbnailer.rb, tag.includefile.process_output: false}}
</pre>

Feel free to copy and adapt it to yours need, but if there are bugs report them in this blog post.
