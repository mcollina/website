# Open Source Projects

<img src="{relocatable:gears.jpg}" class="floatRight"/>

As I believe in Open Source Software I try to contribute whenever I can, mostly
reporting bugs or developing some small application.

I have contributed to the following projects:

*  [Ubuntu][myubuntubugs], for which I usually report bugs about the support
    of my current laptop.
*  [LLIP][llip], which is a small ruby library to parse small languages that
    I developed during a course at university. It's not used by anyone, but
    I think it's a nice proof of concept of a ruby DSL for parsing languages.
